# Learning-Projects
All of the projects within here are completed during the process of learning new skills.
Some projects still may be ongoing.
Code within these projects IS NOT rewritted over time, and so can be used at a later date to analyse errors and learn from mistakes while providing reminders of forgotten methodologies and techniques.

Not all code within here is my own as much of it has been incorporated from videos, courses, books, etc.
